# Infozillion-Data-Toolkit

## Overview

This repository contains the Data-Retrieval-Automation-MNO and Data-Retrieval-Automation-IPTSP scripts, designed to streamline data retrieval from a web application. To achieve the desired results, run the Data-Retrieval-Automation scripts first, then use the data generated by the Selenium scripts as input for the CSV-Error-Analyzer to perform automated error analysis. These tools are developed at [Infozillion Teletech BD Ltd.](https://www.infotelebd.com/) to enhance efficiency and productivity in data-related tasks.

### Mobile Network Operators (MNO):

MNOs provide wireless communication services and play a crucial role in delivering voice calling, text messaging, and mobile data. 

### Internet Protocol Telephone Service Providers (IPTSP):

IPTSPs offer telephony services over the internet using VoIP technology, enabling cost-effective voice calls and text messaging.

### Infozillion Teletech BD Ltd.

Infozillion serves as a vital intermediary (Central Platform), working with raw data to generate valuable insights and services for MNOs and IPTSPs. These scripts are designed to facilitate the data retrieval process for CP, which in turn empowers MNOs and IPTSPs to deliver services to their customers more effectively.

## Data-Retrieval-Automation

The Data-Retrieval-Automation is a Python script that automates a series of tasks using the Selenium web automation framework. It is created to interact with a specific web application, automate login, and download reports.

---

### Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pip install pyautogui`)
- Chrome WebDriver

---

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/iftekharmickey/Infozillion-Data-Toolkit.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```python
   cd Infozillion-Data-Toolkit
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the Chrome WebDriver for your specific Chrome version and platform. Make sure the WebDriver executable is in your system's PATH.

5. Run the script:

   ```python
   python loganalyzer_automation.py
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the start and end times for your task. Ensure you have an internet connection.

7. The script will automate the process and download the necessary reports.

---

### Script Explanation

- The script starts by creating a Chrome WebDriver instance.

- It prompts the user to input the start and end times for a time range.

- It constructs a URL based on the user's time range input and opens that URL in the Chrome browser.

- The script uses PyAutoGUI to enter a username and password and logs in to the web application.

- It then clicks through several elements on the web application to reach the desired report download.

- After downloading the report, the script waits for a few seconds and then closes the browser.

---

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the Chrome WebDriver is compatible with your Chrome browser version. You may need to update the WebDriver if you encounter any issues.

- The script was created and tested for a specific web application. It may require modifications to work with other applications.

- The script may not work if the structure of the web application changes. In such cases, you may need to update the XPath expressions used to locate elements.

## CSV-Error-Analyzer

The CSV-Error-Analyzer is another Python script developed to automate the process of analyzing error occurrences in CSV data. This tool is complementary to the Data-Retrieval-Automation script and is used to process the downloaded CSV files.

---

### Purpose

In the daily workflow of professionals at [Infozillion Teletech BD Ltd.](https://www.infotelebd.com/), dealing with CSV data is common. These CSV files often contain error codes, and analyzing these error occurrences manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.

The CSV-Error-Analyzer automates this process, allowing you to:

- Quickly identify and categorize error occurrences.
- Generate comprehensive error reports for further analysis.
- Improve productivity by eliminating repetitive, manual tasks.

By using this tool in combination with the Data-Retrieval-Automation script, you can enhance your error analysis capabilities and make more informed decisions based on the data.

---

### Usage

1. Clone the [CSV-Error-Analyzer](https://github.com/iftekharmickey/CSV-Error-Analyzer) repository to your local machine.

2. Follow the instructions in the CSV-Error-Analyzer README to install and run the tool.

3. Use the CSV-Error-Analyzer to process and analyze the CSV files downloaded by the Data-Retrieval-Automation script.
